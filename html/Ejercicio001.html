        Whast is XML?
    </h1>
        <ul>
        <li>XML stands for E<strong>X</strong>tensible <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguaje</li>
        <li>XML is a <strong>markup language</strong> much like HTML</li>
        <li>XML was designed to <strong>describe data</strong></li>
        <li>XML tags are not predefined. You must <strong>define your own tags</strong></li>
        <li>XML uses a <strong>Document Type Definition</strong>(DTD) or an <strong>XML Schema</strong> to describe <br> the data</li>
        <li>XML with a DTD or XML Schema is designed to be <strong>self-descriptive</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The main difference between XML and HTML</h1>
    <P>  <strong>XML was designed to carry data.</strong></P>
    <p>XML is not a replacement for HTML. <br>  XML and HTML were designed with different goals:</P>

    <p>XML was designed to describe data and to focus an what data is. <br>HTML was designed to display data and to focus on how data looks.</p>

    <p>HTML is about displaying information, while XML is about describing information.</p>

    <h1> <strong>XML does not DO anything</strong></h1>
    <p> <strong>XML was not designed to Do anything.</strong> </p>

    <p>Maybe it is a litle hard to understand, but XML does nor DO anything. XML was created <br> to structure, store and to send information</p>
    <p>The following example is a note to Tove from Jani, stored as XML:</p>
    <P> The note has a header and messaje body. It also has sender and receiver information. <br>But still, this XML document does not DO anything. It is just pure information wrapped <br>in XML tags. Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive or display it.</P>
